# LocationApiDemoApp
This project implements some features provided by the Google Location API (available in the Google Play Services). They are:

- Location Tracking
  - Get the last known location
  - Receive location updates
  - Display current location address (reverse geocoding)
- Activity Recognition
  - Detect the most probably activity you are doing (e.g.: walking, driving a car, etc)
- Geofencing
  - Create geofences
  - Monitor geofences by adding a notification when you enter and leave in a geofence area

The idea is to help developers to add location awareness to their apps, and show that with the help of the Location API, this is easier than ever.

Note it was developed by using Kotlin.
